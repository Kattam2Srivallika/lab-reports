    The well regulated power supply is desired to ensure that the circuit components operate properly otherwise the fluctuations may cause malfunctions of the circuit operation or damage to the components. In this experiment, we use a zener diode that maintains a constant voltage to regulate D.C. converted output from a full wave rectifier circuit.
