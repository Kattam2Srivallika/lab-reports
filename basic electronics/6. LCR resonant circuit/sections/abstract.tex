    In this experiment, we study the behaviour of a series LCR circuit by measuring voltage across different junctions against different input frequncies.
    Hence we estimate the resonant frequency of the ciruit --- frequency at which the output voltage attains its maximum value. We also determine the Quality factor of the circuit, which represents the efficiency and selectivity of the circuit at resonance. This study contributes to our understanding of LCR circuits and their application in modern electronics.
