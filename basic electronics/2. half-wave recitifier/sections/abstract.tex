A rectifier circuit is used to convert AC current into DC current. In this experiment, we will construct a half-wave rectifier circuit and analyze its output. Additionally, we will also attach a capacitor in shunt to the circuit as a filter and analyse its output. This will demonstrate the need for filters in rectification circuits.
