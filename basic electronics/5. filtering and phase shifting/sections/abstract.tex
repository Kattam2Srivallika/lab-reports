    Passive RC filters filter-out unwanted signals as they separate and allow to pass only those sinusoidal input signals based upon their frequency. Here we construct a first-order passive filter by connecting together a single resistor and a single capacitor in series across an input signal. Depending on which way around we connect the resistor and the capacitor with regards to the output signal determines the type of filter, resulting in either a Low Pass Filter or a High Pass Filter.
