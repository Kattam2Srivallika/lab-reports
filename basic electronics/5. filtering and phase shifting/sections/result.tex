\section{Results and Discussion}
Here we have successfully constructed a RC high-pass and low-pass filter by connecting a single resistor in series with a single capacitor. This single-pole arrangement gives us a roll-off slope of $\pm$20dB/decade attenuation of frequencies after the cut-off point for both the filters respectively.

We can also cascade multiple RC networks to create second and other higher order filters. With this, we can show that the roll-off slope will become steeper, hence approaching its ideal stop band characteristics.

\section{Precautions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Switch on the circuit only after verifying the connections to be proper.
    \item Wait for a while for the values to stabilize, before taking readings from the oscilloscope.
    \item Do not change the resistor or the capacitor while the circuit is switched on.
\end{enumerate}
