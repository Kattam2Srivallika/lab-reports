A Diode is one of the most important and useful devices used in modern electronics. It has various uses in communication systems to  rectifying circuits and power supply systems. The main feauture of a diode is that it only allows the unidirectional flow of current. In this experiment, we try to find the I-V characteristics of the different types of diodes namely the normal PN junction diode and the Zener diode. We also try to determine the variation of the resistance of the diode with applied resistance.
