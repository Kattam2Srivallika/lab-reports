\section{Results and Discussion}
Both the diodes show I-V characterstics as expected.

The Silicon diode under forward bias shows no current until it reaches the threshold voltage, and under reverse bias shows currents of order 3 magnitudes less, which is practically negligible.

Threshold voltage for the Silicon diode was found to be around 

\begin{equation*}
    V_\text{threshold} = 0.65V
\end{equation*}

Static and dynamic resistances at close to the oprating point was found to be 89.53 $\Omega$ and 8.51 $\Omega$ respectively.

The Zener diode also shows similar characterstics as the Silicon diode under forward bias. Under reverse bias, after a certain breakdown voltage, current rapidly increases in the circuit.

For the zener diode, the threshold voltage and the zener breakdown voltage was observed to be around,

\begin{align*}
    V_\text{threshold} = 0.68V\\
    V_\text{breakdown} = 2.50V
\end{align*}

\section{Precautions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Power supply voltage must be varied slowly.
    \item Be sure to not send high amounts of current through the circuit or the circuit components may heat up.
    \item Do not supply more than the breakdown voltage for silicon diodes, or they may get damaged.
    \item Test the parts of the circuit before starting the experiment to make sure they are working.
\end{enumerate}
