\begin{abstract}
A rectifier circuit is used to convert AC current into DC current. In this experiment, we will construct a full wave bridge rectifier circuit, which improves on the previously built half-wave rectifier circuit, by conducting current in both halves of an AC cycle, and analyze its output. Additionally, we will also attach a capacitor in shunt to the circuit as a filter and analyse its output.
