    Different materials react differently in presence of external magnetic fields. Paramagnetic materials are a group of materials which are weakly attracted by an external magnetic field, due to the microscopic structure. This property of a material can be quantified to a physical quantity known as magnetic susceptibility. In this experiment we try to measure the susceptibility of a paramagnetic liquid using mechanical phenomena, in a process called Quincke's method, along with certain other related parameters.
