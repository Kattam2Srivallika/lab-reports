\section{Conclusion}
Our measured values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio is within the the literature values of Y = 50 to 90 GPa and $\sigma$ = 0.2 to 0.7 respectively.

Glass is a brittle material and thus shows very little strain subject to a considerable amount of stress upto the elastic limit. Thus, the high value of Young's modulus observed is justified.

Using this experiment, we can determine the refractive index of an unknown liquid by substituting it with the air-film.

\section{Precautions \& Sources of Error}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The beam should be placed on the knifeâ€“edges symmetrically.
    \item All the glass plates must be plane (optically) and clean.
    \item The travelling microscope must be handled carefully in order to avoid backlash error.
\end{enumerate}
