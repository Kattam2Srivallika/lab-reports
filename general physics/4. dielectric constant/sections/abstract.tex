    In this experiment, we aim to determine the dielectric constants of different materials using a
capacitance-based method. Dielectric constant, also known as relative permittivity, play a crucial
role in the behaviour of electric fields within materials. The experiment involves constructing a
parallel-plate capacitor with known dimensions and inserting various dielectric materials between
the plates, and studying the variation of charge accumulated as a function of external voltage.
